## Entropy
This repo contains code related to the blog post found here https://airpa.io/post/entropy.

There is an AWS CloudFormation template found in `/cft/entropy_research_stk.yaml` which can
create all of the infrastructure and resources needed to follow along with the blog post.

> Warning! This stack will create resources that are not free.

Don't forget to clean-up your resources so that you are not surprised with an unexpected bill from AWS at the end of the month!

The individual .py scripts have been taken from the CFT for readability purposes. The CFT will install these scripts on the EC2 resources.

Happy Hacking!
